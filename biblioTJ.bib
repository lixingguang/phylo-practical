  abstract = {We studied the evolution of leaf size, sapling canopy allometry, and
	related traits in 17 Acer species growing in the understory of temperate
	deciduous forests, using parsimony methods, randomization tests,
	and independent contrasts calculated on a phylogeny inferred from
	nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences. Bivariate
	correlations and multivariate analyses indicated two independent
	suites of coevolving traits, and the results were robust over a range
	of alternative phylogenies. The first suite consisted of strong positive
	correlations among twig thickness, leaf size, inflorescence length,
	and branch spacing (Corner's rules). Seed size and mature height
	were also weakly correlated with these traits. The second suite reflected
	aspects of sapling crown allometry, including crown size, stem diameter,
	and total leaf area, which appear to be related to shade tolerance.
	There was a weak negative correlation between sapling crown size
	and mature height, but no correlation with leaf or seed size. Most
	correlations were similar in magnitude for ahistorical and independent
	contrasts analyses, and discrepancies between these two measures
	were greater in traits with lower levels of convergent evolution.
	The evolutionary correlations among twig, leaf, seed, inflorescence,
	and canopy dimensions emphasize the need for integrated theories
	of evolution and function of these disparate traits.},

  pages = {2249--2256},

  month = {Aug},
  abstract = {Punctuated antigenic change is believed to be a key element in the
	evolution of influenza A; clusters of antigenically similar strains
	predominate worldwide for several years until an antigenically distant
	mutant emerges and instigates a selective sweep. It is thought that
	a region of East-Southeast Asia with year-round transmission acts
	as a source of antigenic diversity for influenza A and seasonal epidemics
	in temperate regions make little contribution to antigenic evolution.
	We use a mathematical model to examine how different transmission
	regimes affect the evolutionary dynamics of influenza over the lifespan
	of an antigenic cluster. Our model indicates that, in non-seasonal
	regions, mutants that cause significant outbreaks appear before the
	peak of the wild-type epidemic. A relatively large proportion of
	these mutants spread globally. In seasonal regions, mutants that
	cause significant local outbreaks appear each year before the seasonal
	peak of the wild-type epidemic, but only a small proportion spread
	globally. The potential for global spread is strongly influenced
	by the intensity of non-seasonal circulation and coupling between
	non-seasonal and seasonal regions. Results are similar if mutations
	are neutral, or confer a weak to moderate antigenic advantage. However,
	there is a threshold antigenic advantage, depending on the non-seasonal
	transmission intensity, beyond which mutants can escape herd immunity
	in the non-seasonal region and there is a global explosion in diversity.
	We conclude that non-seasonal transmission regions are fundamental
	to the generation and maintenance of influenza diversity owing to
	their epidemiology. More extensive sampling of viral diversity in
	such regions could facilitate earlier identification of antigenically
	novel strains and extend the critical window for vaccine development.},

  abstract = {Yersinia pestis invaded the continental United States in 1900 and
	subsequently became established in wild rodent populations in several
	western states, traversing 2,250 km in approximately 40 years. However,
	the specific path of the eastward expansion of plague into the United
	States is poorly understood. We directly calculated velocities of
	disease spread and performed trend-surface analyses on spatio-temporally
	unique plague cases to clarify the route and speed of the initial
	spread of plague eastward. Velocities of disease spread were then
	analyzed using multiple linear regression models to identify environmental
	features that significantly impacted the rate of spread. Between
	one and three introductions of plague along the Pacific coast were
	observed, after which plague traveled from 45 to 87 km/year. In all
	regression models, the coast ranges of California were associated
	with slower spread, and the Southern Rockies were associated with
	a significant increase in the rate of disease spread. Additional
	climatic and environmental factors affecting the velocity of plague's
	spread varied among the models. Maps were developed to graphically
	represent the traveling waves of plague over the United States landscape.
	These analyses identify important large-scale trends regarding the
	eastward invasion of plague into the continental United States that
	can be used to better understand the historical spread of plague,
	as well as how to manage threats from new or re-emerging diseases
	that might operate under similar spatio-temporal dynamics.},

	revealed the influence of drainage pattern, altitude and human-induced
	factors on the pattern of genetic diversity and, particularly, the
	important role of historical events in explaining patterns of contemporary

	genetics of neutral markers are explored in diploid organisms within
	a subdivided population (island model). We use both analytical and
	stochastic simulation approaches. High rates of clonal reproduction
	will positively affect heterozygosity. As a consequence, nearly twice
	as many alleles per locus can be maintained and population differentiation
	estimated as F(ST) value is strongly decreased in purely clonal populations
	as compared to purely sexual ones. With increasing clonal reproduction,
	effective population size first slowly increases and then points
	toward extreme values when the reproductive system tends toward strict
	clonality. This reflects the fact that polymorphism is protected
	within individuals due to fixed heterozygosity. Contrarily, genotypic
	diversity smoothly decreases with increasing rates of clonal reproduction.
	Asexual populations thus maintain higher genetic diversity at each
	single locus but a lower number of different genotypes. Mixed clonal/sexual
	reproduction is nearly indistinguishable from strict sexual reproduction
	as long as the proportion of clonal reproduction is not strongly
	predominant for all quantities investigated, except for genotypic
	diversities (both at individual loci and over multiple loci).},

	on the basis of summary statistics. The method is suited to complex
	problems that arise in population genetics, extending ideas developed
	in this setting by earlier authors. Properties of the posterior distribution
	of a parameter, such as its mean or density curve, are approximated
	without explicit likelihood calculations. This is achieved by fitting
	a local-linear regression of simulated parameter values on simulated
	summary statistics, and then substituting the observed summary statistics
	into the regression equation. The method combines many of the advantages
	of Bayesian statistical inference with the computational efficiency
	of methods based on summary statistics. A key advantage of the method
	is that the nuisance parameters are automatically integrated out
	in the simulation step, so that the large numbers of nuisance parameters
	that arise in population genetics problems can be handled without
	difficulty. Simulation results indicate computational and statistical
	efficiency that compares favorably with those of alternative methods
	previously proposed in the literature. We also compare the relative
	efficiency of inferences obtained using methods based on summary
	statistics with those obtained directly from the data using MCMC.},

	show highly seasonal patterns in temperate regions. Winter is flu
	season. Over the course of the autumn and winter, a small number
	of initial infections grow to encompass a significant proportion
	of the population. At the end of the winter, infection disappears.
	It has been suggested that the strains founding each temperate flu
	season originate from China and Southeast Asia, where influenza A
	is less seasonal. We test this hypothesis through analysis of genetic
	sequences from viruses sampled throughout the world between 1998
	and 2009. We find that although China and Southeast Asia play the
	largest role in the migration network, temperate regions, particularly
	the USA, also make important contributions. Not all temperate strains
	of influenza die out with the end of the winter season. Instead many
	strains emigrate to more favorable climes. Thus, we find patterns
	of influenza transmission to be highly dynamic. Because of emigration
	out of temperate regions, mutations harbored by temperate strains
	of influenza A can spread to the global virus population. This means
	that regional public health decisions regarding influenza may have
	global impacts.</p>},

  abstract = {Dengue is an emerging tropical disease infecting tens of millions
	of people annually. A febrile illness with potentially severe hemorrhagic
	manifestations, dengue is caused by mosquito-borne viruses (DENV-1
	to -4) that are maintained in endemic transmission in large urban
	centers of the tropics with periodic epidemic cycles at 3- to 5-year
	intervals. Puerto Rico (PR), a major population center in the Caribbean,
	has experienced increasingly severe epidemics since multiple dengue
	serotypes were introduced beginning in the late 1970s. We document
	the phylodynamics of DENV-4 between 1981 and 1998, a period of dramatic
	ecological expansion during which evolutionary change also occurs.
	The timescale of viral evolution is sufficiently short that viral
	transmission dynamics can be elucidated from genetic diversity data.
	Specifically, by combining virus sequence data with confirmed case
	counts in PR over these two decades, we show that the pattern of
	cyclic epidemics is strongly correlated with coalescent estimates
	of effective population size that have been estimated from sampled
	virus sequences using Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods.
	Thus, we show that the observed epidemiologic dynamics are correlated
	with similar fluctuations in diversity, including severe interepidemic
	reductions in genetic diversity compatible with population bottlenecks
	that may greatly impact DENV evolutionary dynamics. Mean effective
	population sizes based on genetic data appear to increase prior to
	isolation counts, suggesting a potential bias in the latter and justifying
	more active surveillance of DENV activity. Our analysis explicitly
	integrates epidemiologic and sequence data in a joint model that
	could be used to further explore transmission models of infectious
	disease.},

  abstract = {The analysis of genetic variation to estimate demographic and historical
	parameters and to quantitatively compare alternative scenarios recently
	gained a powerful and flexible approach: the Approximate Bayesian
	Computation (ABC). The likelihood functions does not need to be theoretically
	specified, but posterior distributions can be approximated by simulation
	even assuming very complex population models including both natural
	and human-induced processes. Prior information can be easily incorporated
	and the quality of the results can be analysed with rather limited
	additional effort. ABC is not a statistical analysis per se, but
	rather a statistical framework and any specific application is a
	sort of hybrid between a simulation and a data-analysis study. Complete
	software packages performing the necessary steps under a set of models
	and for specific genetic markers are already available, but the flexibility
	of the method is better exploited combining different programs. Many
	questions relevant in ecology can be addressed using ABC, but adequate
	amount of time should be dedicated to decide among alternative options
	and to evaluate the results. In this paper we will describe and critically
	comment on the different steps of an ABC analysis, analyse some of
	the published applications of ABC and provide user guidelines.},

  abstract = {The relative importance of ancient demography and climate in determining
	worldwide patterns of human within-population phenotypic diversity
	is still open to debate. Several morphometric traits have been argued
	to be under selection by climatic factors, but it is unclear whether
	climate affects the global decline in morphological diversity with
	increasing geographical distance from sub-Saharan Africa. Using a
	large database of male and female skull measurements, we apply an
	explicit framework to quantify the relative role of climate and distance
	from Africa. We show that distance from sub-Saharan Africa is the
	sole determinant of human within-population phenotypic diversity,
	while climate plays no role. By selecting the most informative set
	of traits, it was possible to explain over half of the worldwide
	variation in phenotypic diversity. These results mirror those previously
	obtained for genetic markers and show that 'bones and molecules'
	are in perfect agreement for humans.},

  abstract = { Abstract: Biologists employ phylogenetic comparative methods to study
	adaptive evolution. However, none of the popular methods model selection
	directly. We explain and develop a method based on the Ornstein‐Uhlenbeck
	(OU) process, first proposed by Hansen. Ornstein‐Uhlenbeck models
	incorporate both selection and drift and are thus qualitatively different
	from, and more general than, pure drift models based on Brownian
	motion. Most importantly, OU models possess selective optima that
	formalize the notion of adaptive zone. In this article, we develop
	the method for one quantitative character, discuss interpretations
	of its parameters, and provide code implementing the method. Our
	approach allows us to translate hypotheses regarding adaptation in
	different selective regimes into explicit models, to test the models
	against data using maximum‐likelihood‐based model selection techniques,
	and to infer details of the evolutionary process. We illustrate the
	method using two worked examples. Relative to existing approaches,
	the direct modeling approach we demonstrate allows one to explore
	more detailed hypotheses and to utilize more of the information content
	of comparative data sets than existing methods. Moreover, the use
	of a model selection framework to simultaneously compare a variety
	of hypotheses advances our ability to assess alternative evolutionary
	explanations. },

  abstract = {We propose a transmission model to estimate the main characteristics
	of influenza transmission in households. The model details the risks
	of infection in the household and in the community at the individual
	scale. Heterogeneity among subjects is investigated considering both
	individual susceptibility and infectiousness. The model was applied
	to a data set consisting of the follow-up of influenza symptoms in
	334 households during 15 days after an index case visited a general
	practitioner with virologically confirmed influenza. Estimating the
	parameters of the transmission model was challenging because a large
	part of the infectious process was not observed: only the dates when
	new cases were detected were observed. For each case, the data were
	augmented with the unobserved dates of the start and the end of the
	infectious period. The transmission model was included in a 3-levels
	hierarchical structure: (i) the observation level ensured that the
	augmented data were consistent with the observed data, (ii) the transmission
	level described the underlying epidemic process, (iii) the prior
	level specified the distribution of the parameters. From a Bayesian
	perspective, the joint posterior distribution of model parameters
	and augmented data was explored by Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
	sampling. The mean duration of influenza infectious period was estimated
	at 3.8 days (95 per cent credible interval, 95 per cent CI [3.1,4.6])
	with a standard deviation of 2.0 days (95 per cent CI [1.1,2.8]).
	The instantaneous risk of influenza transmission between an infective
	and a susceptible within a household was found to decrease with the
	size of the household, and established at 0.32 person day(-1) (95
	per cent CI [0.26,0.39]); the instantaneous risk of infection from
	the community was 0.0056 day(-1) (95 per cent CI [0.0029,0.0087]).
	Focusing on the differences in transmission between children (less
	than 15 years old) and adults, we estimated that the former were
	more likely to transmit than adults (posterior probability larger
	than 99 per cent), but that the mean duration of the infectious period
	was similar in children (3.6 days, 95 per cent CI [2.3,5.2]) and
	adults (3.9 days, 95 per cent CI [3.2,4.9]). The posterior probability
	that children had a larger community risk was 76 per cent and the
	posterior probability that they were more susceptible than adults
	was 79 per cent.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: As of June 11, 2009, a total of 17,855 probable or confirmed
	cases of 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) had been reported in the
	United States. Risk factors for transmission remain largely uncharacterized.
	We characterize the risk factors and describe the transmission of
	the virus within households. METHODS: Probable and confirmed cases
	of infection with the 2009 H1N1 virus in the United States were reported
	to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention with the use of
	a standardized case form. We investigated transmission of infection
	in 216 households--including 216 index patients and their 600 household
	contacts--in which the index patient was the first case patient and
	complete information on symptoms and age was available for all household
	members. RESULTS: An acute respiratory illness developed in 78 of
	600 household contacts (13\%). In 156 households (72\% of the 216
	households), an acute respiratory illness developed in none of the
	household contacts; in 46 households (21\%), illness developed in
	one contact; and in 14 households (6\%), illness developed in more
	than one contact. The proportion of household contacts in whom acute
	respiratory illness developed decreased with the size of the household,
	from 28\% in two-member households to 9\% in six-member households.
	Household contacts 18 years of age or younger were twice as susceptible
	as those 19 to 50 years of age (relative susceptibility, 1.96; Bayesian
	95\% credible interval, 1.05 to 3.78; P=0.005), and household contacts
	older than 50 years of age were less susceptible than those who were
	19 to 50 years of age (relative susceptibility, 0.17; 95\% credible
	interval, 0.02 to 0.92; P=0.03). Infectivity did not vary with age.
	The mean time between the onset of symptoms in a case patient and
	the onset of symptoms in the household contacts infected by that
	patient was 2.6 days (95\% credible interval, 2.2 to 3.5). CONCLUSIONS:
	The transmissibility of the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus in households
	is lower than that seen in past pandemics. Most transmissions occur
	soon before or after the onset of symptoms in a case patient.},

	Recent findings indicate that many pathogens escape immunity in a
	punctuated manner; for them, we argue that time series of cases alone
	will be insufficient to isolate causal drivers. We detail observations
	that can reveal the presence of punctuated immune escape, and which
	can be used in new statistical approaches to identify extrinsic and
	intrinsic regulators of disease.},

	and outbreak scenarios with respect to the intrinsic stochasticity
	of disease transmission and traffic flows. To address these issues
	we define a set of quantitative measures able to characterize the

	some countries have almost eliminated MRSA or remained largely free

	control policies. We use a mathematical model to show how these increases
	can be explained by considering both hospital and community reservoirs
	of MRSA colonization. We show how the timing of the intervention,
	the level of resource provision, and chance combine to determine
	whether control measures succeed or fail. We find that even control
	measures able to repeatedly prevent sustained outbreaks in the short-term
	can result in long-term control failure resulting from gradual increases

  abstract = {Estimating detailed transmission trees that reflect the relationships
	between infected individuals or populations during a disease outbreak
	often provides valuable insights into both the nature of disease
	transmission and the overall dynamics of the underlying epidemiological
	process. These trees may be based on epidemiological data that relate
	to the timing of infection and infectiousness, or genetic data that
	show the genetic relatedness of pathogens isolated from infected
	individuals. Genetic data are becoming increasingly important in
	the estimation of transmission trees of viral pathogens due to their
	inherently high mutation rate. Here, we propose a maximum-likelihood
	approach that allows epidemiological and genetic data to be combined
	within the same analysis to infer probable transmission trees. We
	apply this approach to data from 20 farms infected during the 2001
	UK foot-and-mouth disease outbreak, using complete viral genome sequences
	from each infected farm and information on when farms were first
	estimated to have developed clinical disease and when livestock on
	these farms were culled. Incorporating known infection links due
	to animal movement prior to imposition of the national movement ban
	results in the reduction of the number of trees from 41472 that are
	consistent with the genetic data to 1728, of which just 4 represent
	more than 95\% of the total likelihood calculated using a model that
	accounts for the epidemiological data. These trees differ in several
	ways from those constructed prior to the availability of genetic
	data.},

	procedures for measuring the consistency of data with a null hypothesis

	between several kinds of null hypothesis. The ways of deriving tests,
	namely via the so-called absolute test, via implicit consideration
	of alternatives and via explicit consideration of alternatives are
	reviewed. Some of the difficulties of multidimensional alternatives
	are outlined and the importance of the diagnostic ability of a test
	is stressed. Brief examples include tests of distributional form
	including multivariate normality. The effect of modifying statistical
	analysis in the light of the data is discussed, four main cases being
	distinguished. Then a number of more technical aspects of significance
	tests are outlined, including the role of two-sided tests, the role
	of the continuity correction, Bayesian tests and the use of tests
	in the comparison of alternative models. Finally the circumstances
	are reviewed under which significance tests can provide the main
	summary of a statistical analysis.},

  abstract = {Neighbor Joining (NJ), FastME, and other distance-based programs including
	BIONJ, WEIGHBOR, and (to some extent) FITCH, are fast methods to
	build phylogenetic trees. This makes them particularly effective
	for large-scale studies or for bootstrap analysis, which require
	runs on multiple data sets. Like maximum likelihood methods, distance
	methods are based on a sequence evolution model that is used to estimate
	the matrix of pairwise evolutionary distances. Computer simulations
	indicate that the topological accuracy of FastME is best, followed
	by FITCH, WEIGHBOR, and BIONJ, while NJ is worse. Moreover, FastME
	is even faster than NJ with large data sets. Best-distance methods
	are equivalent to parsimony in most cases, but become more accurate
	when the molecular clock is strongly violated or in the presence
	of long (e.g., outgroup) branches. This unit describes how to use
	distance-based methods, focusing on NJ (the most popular) and FastME
	(the most efficient today). It also describes how to estimate evolutionary
	distances from DNA and proteins, how to perform bootstrap analysis,
	and how to use CLUSTAL to compute both a sequence alignment and a
	phylogenetic tree.},

  abstract = {Due to its speed, the distance approach remains the best hope for
	building phylogenies on very large sets of taxa. Recently (R. Desper
	and O. Gascuel, J. Comp. Biol. 9:687-705, 2002), we introduced a
	new "balanced" minimum evolution (BME) principle, based on a branch
	length estimation scheme of Y. Pauplin (J. Mol. Evol. 51:41-47, 2000).
	Initial simulations suggested that FASTME, our program implementing
	the BME principle, was more accurate than or equivalent to all other
	distance methods we tested, with running time significantly faster
	than Neighbor-Joining (NJ). This article further explores the properties
	of the BME principle, and it explains and illustrates its impressive
	topological accuracy. We prove that the BME principle is a special
	case of the weighted least-squares approach, with biologically meaningful
	variances of the distance estimates. We show that the BME principle
	is statistically consistent. We demonstrate that FASTME only produces
	trees with positive branch lengths, a feature that separates this
	approach from NJ (and related methods) that may produce trees with
	branches with biologically meaningless negative lengths. Finally,
	we consider a large simulated data set, with 5,000 100-taxon trees
	generated by the Aldous beta-splitting distribution encompassing
	a range of distributions from Yule-Harding to uniform, and using
	a covarion-like model of sequence evolution. FASTME produces trees
	faster than NJ, and much faster than WEIGHBOR and the weighted least-squares
	implementation of PAUP*. Moreover, FASTME trees are consistently
	more accurate at all settings, ranging from Yule-Harding to uniform
	distributions, and all ranges of maximum pairwise divergence and
	departure from molecular clock. Interestingly, the covarion parameter
	has little effect on the tree quality for any of the algorithms.
	FASTME is freely available on the web.},

  number = {5},
  abstract = {The Minimum Evolution (ME) approach to phylogeny estimation has been
	shown to be statistically consistent when it is used in conjunction
	with ordinary least-squares (OLS) fitting of a metric to a tree structure.
	The traditional approach to using ME has been to start with the Neighbor
	Joining (NJ) topology for a given matrix and then do a topological
	search from that starting point. The first stage requires O(n(3))
	time, where n is the number of taxa, while the current implementations
	of the second are in O(p n(3)) or more, where p is the number of
	swaps performed by the program. In this paper, we examine a greedy
	approach to minimum evolution which produces a starting topology
	in O(n(2)) time. Moreover, we provide an algorithm that searches
	for the best topology using nearest neighbor interchanges (NNIs),
	where the cost of doing p NNIs is O(n(2) + p n), i.e., O(n(2)) in
	practice because p is always much smaller than n. The Greedy Minimum
	Evolution (GME) algorithm, when used in combination with NNIs, produces
	trees which are fairly close to NJ trees in terms of topological
	accuracy. We also examine ME under a balanced weighting scheme, where
	sibling subtrees have equal weight, as opposed to the standard "unweighted"
	OLS, where all taxa have the same weight so that the weight of a
	subtree is equal to the number of its taxa. The balanced minimum
	evolution scheme (BME) runs slower than the OLS version, requiring
	O(n(2) x diam(T)) operations to build the starting tree and O(p n
	x diam(T)) to perform the NNIs, where diam(T) is the topological
	diameter of the output tree. In the usual Yule-Harding distribution
	on phylogenetic trees, the diameter expectation is in log(n), so
	our algorithms are in practice faster that NJ. Moreover, this BME
	scheme yields a very significant improvement over NJ and other distance-based
	algorithms, especially with large trees, in terms of topological
	accuracy.},

  abstract = {We consider the statistical analysis of population structure using
	genetic data. We show how the two most widely used approaches to
	modeling population structure, admixture-based models and principal
	components analysis (PCA), can be viewed within a single unifying
	framework of matrix factorization. Specifically, they can both be
	interpreted as approximating an observed genotype matrix by a product
	of two lower-rank matrices, but with different constraints or prior
	distributions on these lower-rank matrices. This opens the door to
	a large range of possible approaches to analyzing population structure,
	by considering other constraints or priors. In this paper, we introduce
	one such novel approach, based on sparse factor analysis (SFA). We
	investigate the effects of the different types of constraint in several
	real and simulated data sets. We find that SFA produces similar results
	to admixture-based models when the samples are descended from a few
	well-differentiated ancestral populations and can recapitulate the
	results of PCA when the population structure is more "continuous,"
	as in isolation-by-distance models.},

	These experimental results can be easily reproduced in silico and
	they should apply to a wide variety of higher organisms. They also
	suggest that a single range expansion can create very complex patterns
	at neutral loci, mimicking adaptive processes and resembling postglacial
	segregation of clades from distinct refuge areas.},

	Although currently incapable of sustained human-to-human transmission,
	H5N1 represents a serious pandemic threat owing to the risk of a
	mutation or reassortment generating a virus with increased transmissibility.
	Identifying public health interventions that might be able to halt
	a pandemic in its earliest stages is therefore a priority. Here we
	use a simulation model of influenza transmission in Southeast Asia
	to evaluate the potential effectiveness of targeted mass prophylactic
	use of antiviral drugs as a containment strategy. Other interventions
	aimed at reducing population contact rates are also examined as reinforcements
	to an antiviral-based containment policy. We show that elimination
	of a nascent pandemic may be feasible using a combination of geographically
	targeted prophylaxis and social distancing measures, if the basic
	reproduction number of the new virus is below 1.8. We predict that
	a stockpile of 3 million courses of antiviral drugs should be sufficient
	for elimination. Policy effectiveness depends critically on how quickly
	clinical cases are diagnosed and the speed with which antiviral drugs
	can be distributed.},

  abstract = {Development of strategies for mitigating the severity of a new influenza
	pandemic is now a top global public health priority. Influenza prevention
	and containment strategies can be considered under the broad categories
	of antiviral, vaccine and non-pharmaceutical (case isolation, household
	quarantine, school or workplace closure, restrictions on travel)
	measures. Mathematical models are powerful tools for exploring this
	complex landscape of intervention strategies and quantifying the
	potential costs and benefits of different options. Here we use a
	large-scale epidemic simulation to examine intervention options should
	initial containment of a novel influenza outbreak fail, using Great
	Britain and the United States as examples. We find that border restrictions
	and/or internal travel restrictions are unlikely to delay spread
	by more than 2-3 weeks unless more than 99\% effective. School closure
	during the peak of a pandemic can reduce peak attack rates by up
	to 40\%, but has little impact on overall attack rates, whereas case
	isolation or household quarantine could have a significant impact,
	if feasible. Treatment of clinical cases can reduce transmission,
	but only if antivirals are given within a day of symptoms starting.
	Given enough drugs for 50\% of the population, household-based prophylaxis
	coupled with reactive school closure could reduce clinical attack
	rates by 40-50\%. More widespread prophylaxis would be even more
	logistically challenging but might reduce attack rates by over 75\%.
	Vaccine stockpiled in advance of a pandemic could significantly reduce
	attack rates even if of low efficacy. Estimates of policy effectiveness
	will change if the characteristics of a future pandemic strain differ
	substantially from those seen in past pandemics.},

  abstract = {In pandemic and epidemic forms, influenza causes substantial, sometimes
	catastrophic, morbidity and mortality. Intense selection from the
	host immune system drives antigenic change in influenza A and B,
	resulting in continuous replacement of circulating strains with new
	variants able to re-infect hosts immune to earlier types. This 'antigenic
	drift' often requires a new vaccine to be formulated before each
	annual epidemic. However, given the high transmissibility and mutation
	rate of influenza, the constancy of genetic diversity within lineages
	over time is paradoxical. Another enigma is the replacement of existing
	strains during a global pandemic caused by 'antigenic shift'--the
	introduction of a new avian influenza A subtype into the human population.
	Here we explore ecological and immunological factors underlying these
	patterns using a mathematical model capturing both realistic epidemiological
	dynamics and viral evolution at the sequence level. By matching model
	output to phylogenetic patterns seen in sequence data collected through
	global surveillance, we find that short-lived strain-transcending
	immunity is essential to restrict viral diversity in the host population

	depicting how human genetic diversity varies across geographic space.
	Within Europe, the first axis of variation (PC1) was interpreted
	as evidence for the demic diffusion model of agriculture, in which
	farmers expanded from the Near East approximately 10,000 years ago
	and replaced the resident hunter-gatherer populations with little
	or no interbreeding. These interpretations of the PC maps have been
	recently questioned as the original results can be reproduced under
	models of spatially covarying allele frequencies without any expansion.
	Here, we study PC maps for data simulated under models of range expansion
	and admixture. Our simulations include a spatially realistic model
	of Neolithic farmer expansion and assume various levels of interbreeding
	between farmer and resident hunter-gatherer populations. An important
	result is that under a broad range of conditions, the gradients in
	PC1 maps are oriented along a direction perpendicular to the axis
	of the expansion, rather than along the same axis as the expansion.
	We propose that this surprising pattern is an outcome of the "allele
	surfing" phenomenon, which creates sectors of high allele-frequency
	differentiation that align perpendicular to the direction of the
	expansion.},

	and viral genetic diversity, we make an early assessment of transmissibility
	and severity. Our estimates suggest that 23,000 (range 6,000-32,000)
	individuals had been infected in Mexico by late April, giving an
	estimated case fatality ratio (CFR) of 0.4% (range 0.3% to 1.5%)
	based on confirmed and suspect deaths reported to that time. In a
	community outbreak in the small community of La Gloria, Veracruz
	no deaths were attributed to infection, giving an upper 95% bound
	on CFR of 0.6%. Thus while substantial uncertainty remains, clinical
	severity appears less than that seen in 1918 but comparable with
	that seen in 1957. Clinical attack rates in children in La Gloria
	were twice that in adults (<15 years-of-age: 61%, [&ge;]15: 29%).
	Three different epidemiological analyses gave R0 estimates in the
	range 1.4-1.6, while a genetic analysis gave a central estimate of
	1.2. This range of values is, consistent with 14 to 73 generations
	of human-to-human transmission having occurred in Mexico to late
	April. Transmissibility is therefore substantially higher than seasonal
	flu, and comparable with lower estimates of R0 obtained from previous
	influenza pandemics.},

  abstract = {The question is often raised whether it is statistically necessary
	to control for phylogenetic associations in comparative studies.
	To investigate this question, we explore the use of a measure of
	phylogenetic correlation, lambda, introduced by Pagel (1999), that
	normally varies between 0 (phylogenetic independence) and 1 (species'
	traits covary in direct proportion to their shared evolutionary history).
	Simulations show lambda to be a statistically powerful index for
	measuring whether data exhibit phylogenetic dependence or not and
	whether it has low rates of Type I error. Moreover, lambda is robust
	to incomplete phylogenetic information, which demonstrates that even
	partial information on phylogeny will improve the accuracy of phylogenetic
	analyses. To assess whether traits generally show phylogenetic associations,
	we present a quantitative review of 26 published phylogenetic comparative
	data sets. The data sets include 103 traits and were chosen from
	the ecological literature in which debate about the need for phylogenetic
	correction has been most acute. Eighty-eight percent of data sets
	contained at least one character that displayed significant phylogenetic
	dependence, and 60\% of characters overall (pooled across studies)
	showed significant evidence of phylogenetic association. In 16\%
	of tests, phylogenetic correlation could be neither supported nor
	rejected. However, most of these equivocal results were found in
	small phylogenies and probably reflect a lack of power. We suggest
	that the parameter lambda be routinely estimated when analyzing comparative
	data, since it can also be used simultaneously to adjust the phylogenetic
	correction in a manner that is optimal for the data set, and we present
	an example of how this may be done.},

	in general, a single change in time scale cannot be used to estimate

  abstract = {Over the past two decades, comparative biological analyses have undergone
	profound changes with the incorporation of rigorous evolutionary
	perspectives and phylogenetic information. This change followed in
	large part from the realization that traditional methods of statistical
	analysis tacitly assumed independence of all observations, when in
	fact biological groups such as species are differentially related
	to each other according to their evolutionary history. New phylogenetically
	based analytical methods were then rapidly developed, incorporated
	into ;the comparative method', and applied to many physiological,
	biochemical, morphological and behavioral investigations. We now
	review the rationale for including phylogenetic information in comparative
	studies and briefly discuss three methods for doing this (independent
	contrasts, generalized least-squares models, and Monte Carlo computer
	simulations). We discuss when and how to use phylogenetic information
	in comparative studies and provide several examples in which it has
	been helpful, or even crucial, to a comparative analysis. We also
	consider some difficulties with phylogenetically based statistical
	methods, and of comparative approaches in general, both practical
	and theoretical. It is our personal opinion that the incorporation
	of phylogeny information into comparative studies has been highly
	beneficial, not only because it can improve the reliability of statistical
	inferences, but also because it continually emphasizes the potential
	importance of past evolutionary history in determining current form
	and function.},

	mutable marker loci allow determination of Y. pestis population genetic
	structure and tracking of transmission patterns at two spatial scales

	rates for these loci are similar to those observed in vivo, which
	allowed us to develop a mutation-rate-based model to examine transmission
	mechanisms. Our model suggests there are two primary components of
	plague ecology: a rapid expansion phase for population growth and
	dispersal followed by a slower persistence phase. This pattern seems

  pages = {289},
  abstract = {Effective population size (Ne) is related to genetic variability and
	is a basic parameter in many models of population genetics. A number
	of methods for inferring current and past population sizes from genetic
	data have been developed since JFC Kingman introduced the n-coalescent
	in 1982. Here we present the Extended Bayesian Skyline Plot, a non-parametric
	Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm that extends a previous
	coalescent-based method in several ways, including the ability to
	analyze multiple loci.Through extensive simulations we show the accuracy
	and limitations of inferring population size as a function of the
	amount of data, including recovering information about evolutionary
	bottlenecks. We also analyzed two real data sets to demonstrate the
	behavior of the new method; a single gene Hepatitis C virus data
	set sampled from Egypt and a 10 locus Drosophila ananassae data set
	representing 16 different populations.The results demonstrate the
	essential role of multiple loci in recovering population size dynamics.
	Multi-locus data from a small number of individuals can precisely
	recover past bottlenecks in population size which can not be characterized
	by analysis of a single locus. We also demonstrate that sequence
	data quality is important because even moderate levels of sequencing
	errors result in a considerable decrease in estimation accuracy for
	realistic levels of population genetic variability.},

	in numerous unrelated clades of insects, flatworms, and angiosperms.
	Chromosome number changes in such organisms often result from fission
	and fusion events rather than polyploidy. In this study, I test the
	hypothesis that chromosome number evolves according to a uniform
	process in Carex section Ovales (Cyperaceae), the largest New World
	section of an angiosperm genus renowned for its chromosomal variability
	and species richness. I evaluate alternative models of chromosome
	evolution that allow for shifts in both stochastic and deterministic
	evolutionary processes and that quantify the rate of evolution and
	heritability/phylogenetic dependence of chromosome number. Estimates
	of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model parameters and tree-scaling parameters
	in a generalized least squares framework demonstrate that (1) chromosome
	numbers evolve rapidly toward clade-specific stationary distributions
	that cannot be explained by constant variance (Brownian motion) evolutionary
	models, (2) chromosome evolution in the section is rapid and exhibits
	little phylogenetic inertia, and (3) explaining the phylogenetic
	pattern of chromosome numbers in the section entails inferring a
	shift in evolutionary dynamics at the root of a derived clade. The
	finding that chromosome evolution is not a uniform process in sedges
	provides a novel example of karyotypic orthoselection in an organism
	with holocentric chromosomes.},

  abstract = {Non-random patterns of genetic variation exist among individuals in
	a population owing to a variety of evolutionary factors. Therefore,
	populations are structured into genetically distinct subpopulations.
	As genotypic datasets become ever larger, it is increasingly difficult
	to correctly estimate the number of subpopulations and assign individuals
	to them. The computationally efficient non-parametric, chiefly Principal
	Components Analysis (PCA)-based methods are thus becoming increasingly
	relied upon for population structure analysis. Current PCA-based
	methods can accurately detect structure; however, the accuracy in
	resolving subpopulations and assigning individuals to them is wanting.
	When subpopulations are closely related to one another, they overlap
	in PCA space and appear as a conglomerate. This problem is exacerbated
	when some subpopulations in the dataset are genetically far removed
	from others. We propose a novel PCA-based framework which addresses
	this shortcoming.A novel population structure analysis algorithm
	called iterative pruning PCA (ipPCA) was developed which assigns
	individuals to subpopulations and infers the total number of subpopulations
	present. Genotypic data from simulated and real population datasets
	with different degrees of structure were analyzed. For datasets with
	simple structures, the subpopulation assignments of individuals made
	by ipPCA were largely consistent with the STRUCTURE, BAPS and AWclust
	algorithms. On the other hand, highly structured populations containing
	many closely related subpopulations could be accurately resolved
	only by ipPCA, and not by other methods.The algorithm is computationally
	efficient and not constrained by the dataset complexity. This systematic
	subpopulation assignment approach removes the need for prior population
	labels, which could be advantageous when cryptic stratification is
	encountered in datasets containing individuals otherwise assumed
	to belong to a homogenous population.},

	importance; however, with increasing reports of incidence and the
	discovery of antibiotic-resistant strains of the plague bacterium
	Yersinia pestis, it is re-emerging as a significant health concerns.
	Here we bypass the conventional human-disease models, and propose
	that bubonic plague is driven by the dynamics of the disease in the
	rat population. Using a stochastic, spatial metapopulation model,
	we show that bubonic plague can persist in relatively small rodent
	populations from which occasional human epidemics arise, without
	the need for external imports. This explains why historically the
	plague persisted despite long disease-free periods, and how the disease
	re-occurred in cities with tight quarantine control. In a contemporary
	setting, we show that human vaccination cannot eradicate the plague,
	and that culling of rats may prevent or exacerbate human epidemics,
	depending on the timing of the cull. The existence of plague reservoirs
	in wild rodent populations has important public-health implications
	for the transmission to urban rats and the subsequent risk of human
	outbreaks.},

	thus model adequacy remains a crucial issue for phylogenetics and
	its many applications. Although progress has been made in selecting
	appropriate models for phylogeny estimation, there is still concern
	about their purpose and proper use. How do we interpret models in
	a phylogenetic context? What are their effects on phylogeny estimation?
	How can we improve confidence in the models that we choose? That
	the phylogenetics community is asking such questions denotes an important
	stage in the use of explicit models. Here, we examine these and other
	common questions and draw conclusions about how the community is
	using and choosing models, and where this process will take us next.},

	By introducing an epidemiological model that allows for differences
	between the genetic and antigenic properties of the virus's hemagglutinin,
	we show that these patterns can arise from cluster-specific immunity
	alone. Central to the formulation is a genotype-to-phenotype mapping,
	based on neutral networks, with antigenic phenotypes, not genotypes,
	determining the degree of strain cross-immunity. The model parsimoniously
	explains well-known, as well as previously unremarked, features of
	interpandemic influenza dynamics and evolution. It captures the observed
	boom-and-bust pattern of viral evolution, with periods of antigenic
	stasis during which genetic diversity grows, and with episodic contraction
	of this diversity during cluster transitions.},

  journal = {J R Soc Interface},
  year = {2011},
  month = {Sep},
  abstract = {Coalescent theory provides a mathematical framework for quantitatively
	interpreting gene genealogies. With the increased availability of
	molecular sequence data, disease ecologists now regularly apply this
	body of theory to viral phylogenies, most commonly in attempts to
	reconstruct demographic histories of infected individuals and to
	estimate parameters such as the basic reproduction number. However,
	with few exceptions, the mathematical expressions at the core of
	coalescent theory have not been explicitly linked to the structure
	of epidemiological models, which are commonly used to mathematically
	describe the transmission dynamics of a pathogen. Here, we aim to
	make progress towards establishing this link by presenting a general
	approach for deriving a model's rate of coalescence under the assumption
	that the disease dynamics are at their endemic equilibrium. We apply
	this approach to four common families of epidemiological models:
	standard susceptible-infected-susceptible/susceptible-infected-recovered/susceptible-infected-recovered-susceptible
	models, models with individual heterogeneity in infectivity, models
	with an exposed but not yet infectious class and models with variable
	distributions of the infectious period. These results improve our
	understanding of how epidemiological processes shape viral genealogies,
	as well as how these processes affect levels of viral diversity and
	rates of genetic drift. Finally, we discuss how a subset of these
	coalescent rate expressions can be used for phylodynamic inference
	in non-equilibrium settings. For the ones that are limited to equilibrium
	conditions, we also discuss why this is the case. These results,
	therefore, point towards necessary future work while providing intuition
	on how epidemiological characteristics of the infection process impact
	gene genealogies.},

  abstract = {Antigenically variable RNA viruses are significant contributors to
	the burden of infectious disease worldwide. One reason for their
	ubiquity is their ability to escape herd immunity through rapid antigenic
	evolution and thereby to reinfect previously infected hosts. However,
	the ways in which these viruses evolve antigenically are highly diverse.
	Some have only limited diversity in the long-run, with every emergence
	of a new antigenic variant coupled with a replacement of the older
	variant. Other viruses rapidly accumulate antigenic diversity over
	time. Others still exhibit dynamics that can be considered evolutionary
	intermediates between these two extremes. Here, we present a theoretical
	framework that aims to understand these differences in evolutionary
	patterns by considering a virus's epidemiological dynamics in a given
	host population. Our framework, based on a dimensionless number,
	probabilistically anticipates patterns of viral antigenic diversification
	and thereby quantifies a virus's evolutionary potential. It is therefore
	similar in spirit to the basic reproduction number, the well-known
	dimensionless number which quantifies a pathogen's reproductive potential.
	We further outline how our theoretical framework can be applied to
	empirical viral systems, using influenza A/H3N2 as a case study.
	We end with predictions of our framework and work that remains to
	be done to further integrate viral evolutionary dynamics with disease
	ecology.},

  abstract = {Principal component analysis (PCA) has gained popularity as a method
	for the analysis of high-dimensional genomic data. However, it is
	often difficult to interpret the results because the principal components
	are linear combinations of all variables, and the coefficients (loadings)
	are typically nonzero. These nonzero values also reflect poor estimation
	of the true vector loadings; for example, for gene expression data,
	biologically we expect only a portion of the genes to be expressed
	in any tissue, and an even smaller fraction to be involved in a particular
	process. Sparse PCA methods have recently been introduced for reducing
	the number of nonzero coefficients, but these existing methods are
	not satisfactory for high-dimensional data applications because they
	still give too many nonzero coefficients.Here we propose a new PCA
	method that uses two innovations to produce an extremely sparse loading
	vector: (i) a random-effect model on the loadings that leads to an
	unbounded penalty at the origin and (ii) shrinkage of the singular
	values obtained from the singular value decomposition of the data
	matrix. We develop a stable computing algorithm by modifying nonlinear
	iterative partial least square (NIPALS) algorithm, and illustrate
	the method with an analysis of the NCI cancer dataset that contains
	21,225 genes.The new method has better performance than several existing
	methods, particularly in the estimation of the loading vectors.},

  abstract = {Currently available genetic and archaeological evidence is generally
	interpreted as supportive of a recent single origin of modern humans
	in East Africa. However, this is where the near consensus on human
	settlement history ends, and considerable uncertainty clouds any
	more detailed aspect of human colonization history. Here, we present
	a dynamic genetic model of human settlement history coupled with
	explicit geographical distances from East Africa, the likely origin
	of modern humans. We search for the best-supported parameter space
	by fitting our analytical prediction to genetic data that are based
	on 52 human populations analyzed at 783 autosomal microsatellite
	markers. This framework allows us to jointly estimate the key parameters
	of the expansion of modern humans. Our best estimates suggest an
	initial expansion of modern humans approximately 56,000 years ago
	from a small founding population of approximately 1,000 effective
	individuals. Our model further points to high growth rates in newly
	colonized habitats. The general fit of the model with the data is
	excellent. This suggests that coupling analytical genetic models
	with explicit demography and geography provides a powerful tool for
	making inferences on human-settlement history.},

  abstract = {Population-level analyses often use average quantities to describe
	heterogeneous systems, particularly when variation does not arise
	from identifiable groups. A prominent example, central to our current
	understanding of epidemic spread, is the basic reproductive number,
	R(0), which is defined as the mean number of infections caused by
	an infected individual in a susceptible population. Population estimates
	of R(0) can obscure considerable individual variation in infectiousness,
	as highlighted during the global emergence of severe acute respiratory
	syndrome (SARS) by numerous 'superspreading events' in which certain
	individuals infected unusually large numbers of secondary cases.
	For diseases transmitted by non-sexual direct contacts, such as SARS
	or smallpox, individual variation is difficult to measure empirically,
	and thus its importance for outbreak dynamics has been unclear. Here
	we present an integrated theoretical and statistical analysis of
	the influence of individual variation in infectiousness on disease
	emergence. Using contact tracing data from eight directly transmitted
	diseases, we show that the distribution of individual infectiousness
	around R(0) is often highly skewed. Model predictions accounting
	for this variation differ sharply from average-based approaches,
	with disease extinction more likely and outbreaks rarer but more
	explosive. Using these models, we explore implications for outbreak
	control, showing that individual-specific control measures outperform
	population-wide measures. Moreover, the dramatic improvements achieved
	through targeted control policies emphasize the need to identify
	predictive correlates of higher infectiousness. Our findings indicate
	that superspreading is a normal feature of disease spread, and to
	frame ongoing discussion we propose a rigorous definition for superspreading
	events and a method to predict their frequency.},

  abstract = {Using the guinea pig as a model host, we show that aerosol spread
	of influenza virus is dependent upon both ambient relative humidity
	and temperature. Twenty experiments performed at relative humidities
	from 20\% to 80\% and 5 degrees C, 20 degrees C, or 30 degrees C
	indicated that both cold and dry conditions favor transmission. The
	relationship between transmission via aerosols and relative humidity
	at 20 degrees C is similar to that previously reported for the stability
	of influenza viruses (except at high relative humidity, 80\%), implying
	that the effects of humidity act largely at the level of the virus
	particle. For infected guinea pigs housed at 5 degrees C, the duration
	of peak shedding was approximately 40 h longer than that of animals
	housed at 20 degrees C; this increased shedding likely accounts for
	the enhanced transmission seen at 5 degrees C. To investigate the
	mechanism permitting prolonged viral growth, expression levels in
	the upper respiratory tract of several innate immune mediators were
	determined. Innate responses proved to be comparable between animals
	housed at 5 degrees C and 20 degrees C, suggesting that cold temperature
	(5 degrees C) does not impair the innate immune response in this
	system. Although the seasonal epidemiology of influenza is well characterized,
	the underlying reasons for predominant wintertime spread are not
	clear. We provide direct, experimental evidence to support the role
	of weather conditions in the dynamics of influenza and thereby address
	a long-standing question fundamental to the understanding of influenza
	epidemiology and evolution.},

  abstract = {The emergence of antibiotic resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis
	has raised the concern that pathogen strains that are virtually untreatable
	may become widespread. The acquisition of resistance to antibiotics
	results in a longer duration of infection in a host, but this resistance
	may come at a cost through a decreased transmission rate. This raises
	the question of whether the overall fitness of drug-resistant strains
	is higher than that of sensitive strains--essential information for
	predicting the spread of the disease. Here, we directly estimate
	the transmission cost of drug resistance, the rate at which resistance
	evolves, and the relative fitness of resistant strains. These estimates
	are made by using explicit models of the transmission and evolution
	of sensitive and resistant strains of M. tuberculosis, using approximate
	Bayesian computation, and molecular epidemiology data from Cuba,
	Estonia, and Venezuela. We find that the transmission cost of drug
	resistance relative to sensitivity can be as low as 10\%, that resistance
	evolves at rates of approximately 0.0025-0.02 per case per year,
	and that the overall fitness of resistant strains is comparable with
	that of sensitive strains. Furthermore, the contribution of transmission
	to the spread of drug resistance is very high compared with acquired
	resistance due to treatment failure (up to 99\%). Estimating such
	parameters directly from in vivo data will be critical to understanding
	and responding to antibiotic resistance. For instance, projections
	using our estimates suggest that the prevalence of tuberculosis may
	decline with successful treatment, but the proportion of cases associated
	with resistance is likely to increase.},

  abstract = {The origin and patterns of dispersal of anatomically modern humans
	are the focus of considerable debate. Global genetic analyses have
	argued for one single origin, placed somewhere in Africa. This scenario
	implies a rapid expansion, with a series of bottlenecks of small
	amplitude, which would have led to the observed smooth loss of genetic
	diversity with increasing distance from Africa. Analyses of cranial
	data, on the other hand, have given mixed results, and have been
	argued to support multiple origins of modern humans. Using a large
	data set of skull measurements and an analytical framework equivalent
	to that used for genetic data, we show that the loss in genetic diversity
	has been mirrored by a loss in phenotypic variability. We find evidence
	for an African origin, placed somewhere in the central/southern part
	of the continent, which harbours the highest intra-population diversity
	in phenotypic measurements. We failed to find evidence for a second
	origin, and we confirm these results on a large genetic data set.
	Distance from Africa accounts for an average 19-25\% of heritable
	variation in craniometric measurements-a remarkably strong effect
	for phenotypic measurements known to be under selection.},

  abstract = {Recently, the utility of modern phylogenetic comparative methods (PCMs)
	has been questioned because of the seemingly restrictive assumptions
	required by these methods. Although most comparative analyses involve
	traits thought to be undergoing natural or sexual selection, most
	PCMs require an assumption that the traits be evolving by less directed
	random processes, such as Brownian motion (BM). In this study, we
	use computer simulation to generate data under more realistic evolutionary
	scenarios and consider the statistical abilities of a variety of
	PCMs to estimate correlation coefficients from these data. We found
	that correlations estimated without taking phylogeny into account
	were often quite poor and never substantially better than those produced
	by the other tested methods. In contrast, most PCMs performed quite
	well even when their assumptions were violated. Felsenstein's independent
	contrasts (FIC) method gave the best performance in many cases, even
	when weak constraints had been acting throughout phenotypic evolution.
	When strong constraints acted in opposition to variance-generating
	(i.e., BM) forces, however, FIC correlation coefficients were biased
	in the direction of those BM forces. In most cases, all other PCMs
	tested (phylogenetic generalized least squares, phylogenetic mixed
	model, spatial autoregression, and phylogenetic eigenvector regression)
	yielded good statistical performance, regardless of the details of
	the evolutionary model used to generate the data. Actual parameter
	estimates given by different PCMs for each dataset, however, were
	occasionally very different from one another, suggesting that the
	choice among them should depend on the types of traits and evolutionary
	processes being considered.},

	loci that were virtually identical across all populations sampled.
	Our data indicate that the neutrality hypothesis is untenable for
	the loci studied, and therefore selection is indicated as the major
	factor responsible for producing these patterns. Thorough ecological
	work allowed gene flow to be ruled out (in almost all instances)
	as a factor maintaining similar gene frequencies across populations.
	The Lewontin-Krakauer test indicated magnitudes of heterogeneity
	among standardized variances of gene frequencies inconsistent with
	the neutrality hypothesis. The question of whether or not to correct
	this statistic for sample size is discussed. Observed equitability
	of gene frequencies of multiple allelic loci was found to be greater
	than that predicted under the neutrality hypothesis. Genetic differentiation
	presisting through two generations was found between the one pair
	of populations known to exchange significant numbers of individuals
	per generation. Two matrices of genetic distance between populations,
	based on the eight loci sampled, were found to be significantly correlated
	with a matrix of environmental distance, based on measures of fourteen
	environmental parameters. Correlations between gene frequencies and
	environmental parameters, results of multiple regression analysis,
	and results of principle component analysis showed strong patterns
	of association and of "explained" variation. The correlation analyses
	suggest which factors might be further investigated as proximate
	selective agents.},

  abstract = {Despite growing interest in the effects of landscape heterogeneity
	on genetic structuring, few tools are available to incorporate data
	on landscape composition into population genetic studies. Analyses
	of isolation by distance have typically either assumed spatial homogeneity
	for convenience or applied theoretically unjustified distance metrics
	to compensate for heterogeneity. Here I propose the isolation-by-resistance
	(IBR) model as an alternative for predicting equilibrium genetic
	structuring in complex landscapes. The model predicts a positive
	relationship between genetic differentiation and the resistance distance,
	a distance metric that exploits precise relationships between random
	walk times and effective resistances in electronic networks. As a
	predictor of genetic differentiation, the resistance distance is
	both more theoretically justified and more robust to spatial heterogeneity
	than Euclidean or least cost path-based distance measures. Moreover,
	the metric can be applied with a wide range of data inputs, including
	coarse-scale range maps, simple maps of habitat and nonhabitat within
	a species' range, or complex spatial datasets with habitats and barriers
	of differing qualities. The IBR model thus provides a flexible and
	efficient tool to account for habitat heterogeneity in studies of
	isolation by distance, improve understanding of how landscape characteristics
	affect genetic structuring, and predict genetic and evolutionary
	consequences of landscape change.},

	typically demonstrates structure arising from diverse processes including

	One technique commonly used to uncover such structure is principal
	components analysis, which identifies the primary axes of variation
	in data and projects the samples onto these axes in a graphically
	appealing and intuitive manner. However, as the method is non-parametric,
	it can be hard to relate PCA to underlying process. Here, I show
	that the underlying genealogical history of the samples can be related
	directly to the PC projection. The result is useful because it is
	straightforward to predict the effects of different demographic processes
	on the sample genealogy. However, the result also reveals the limitations
	of PCA, in that multiple processes can give the same projections,
	it is strongly influenced by uneven sampling, and it discards important
	information in the spatial structure of genetic variation along chromosomes.</p>},

	the spread of an infectious disease, we need to better understand
	how pathogens spread within a host population, yet this is something
	we know remarkably little about. Cases close together in their locations
	and timing are often thought to be linked, but timings and locations
	alone are usually consistent with many different scenarios of who-infected-who.
	The genome of many pathogens evolves so quickly relative to the rate
	that they are transmitted, that even over single short epidemics
	we can identify which hosts contain pathogens that are most closely
	related to each other. This information is valuable because when
	combined with the spatial and timing data it should help us infer
	more reliably who-transmitted-to-who over the course of a disease
	outbreak. However, doing this so that these three different lines
	of evidence are appropriately weighted and interpreted remains a
	major statistical challenge. In our paper we present a new statistical
	method for combining these different types of data and estimating

	in characterizing and understanding the evolution of mitochondrial
	DNA, the most popular marker of molecular biodiversity. Several important
	results were recently reported using mammals as model organisms,
	including (i) the absence of relationship between mitochondrial DNA
	diversity and life-history or ecological variables, (ii) the absence
	of prominent adaptive selection, contrary to what was found in invertebrates,
	and (iii) the unexpectedly large variation in neutral substitution
	rate among lineages, revealing a possible link with species maximal
	longevity. We propose to challenge these results thanks to the bird/mammal
	comparison. Direct estimates of population size are available in
	birds, and this group presents striking life-history trait differences
	with mammals (higher mass-specific metabolic rate and longevity).
	These properties make birds the ideal model to directly test for
	population size effects, and to discriminate between competing hypotheses
	about the causes of substitution rate variation. RESULTS: A phylogenetic
	analysis of cytochrome b third-codon position confirms that the mitochondrial
	DNA mutation rate is quite variable in birds, passerines being the
	fastest evolving order. On average, mitochondrial DNA evolves slower
	in birds than in mammals of similar body size. This result is in
	agreement with the longevity hypothesis, and contradicts the hypothesis
	of a metabolic rate-dependent mutation rate. Birds show no footprint
	of adaptive selection on cytochrome b evolutionary patterns, but
	no link between direct estimates of population size and cytochrome
	b diversity. The mutation rate is the best predictor we have of within-species
	mitochondrial diversity in birds. It partly explains the differences
	in mitochondrial DNA diversity patterns observed between mammals
	and birds, previously interpreted as reflecting Hill-Robertson interferences
	with the W chromosome. CONCLUSION: Mitochondrial DNA diversity patterns
	in birds are strongly influenced by the wide, unexpected variation
	of mutation rate across species. From a fundamental point of view,
	these results are strongly consistent with a relationship between
	species maximal longevity and mitochondrial mutation rate, in agreement
	with the mitochondrial theory of ageing. Form an applied point of
	view, this study reinforces and extends the message of caution previously
	expressed for mammals: mitochondrial data tell nothing about species
	population sizes, and strongly depart the molecular clock assumption.},

  abstract = {Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is the most popular marker of molecular
	diversity in animals, primarily because of its elevated mutation
	rate. After >20 years of intensive usage, the extent of mitochondrial
	evolutionary rate variations across species, their practical consequences
	on sequence analysis methods, and the ultimate reasons for mtDNA
	hypermutability are still largely unresolved issues. Using an extensive
	cytochrome b data set, fossil data, and taking advantage of the decoupled
	dynamics of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions, we measure
	the lineage-specific mitochondrial mutation rate across 1,696 mammalian
	species and compare it with the nuclear rate. We report an unexpected
	2 orders of magnitude mitochondrial mutation rate variation between
	lineages: cytochrome b third codon positions are renewed every 1-2
	Myr, in average, in the fastest evolving mammals, whereas it takes
	>100 Myr in slow-evolving lineages. This result has obvious implications
	in the fields of molecular phylogeny, molecular dating, and population
	genetics. Variations of mitochondrial substitution rate across species
	are partly explained by body mass, longevity, and age of female sexual
	maturity. The classical metabolic rate and generation time hypothesis,
	however, do not fully explain the observed patterns, especially a
	stronger effect of longevity in long-lived than in short-lived species.
	We propose that natural selection tends to decrease the mitochondrial
	mutation rate in long-lived species, in agreement with the mitochondrial
	theory of aging.},

  abstract = {Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is one of the most popular population genetic
	markers. Its relevance as an indicator of population size and history
	has recently been questioned by several large-scale studies in animals
	reporting evidence for recurrent adaptive evolution, at least in
	invertebrates. Here we focus on mammals, a more restricted taxonomic
	group for which the issue of mtDNA near neutrality is crucial. By
	analyzing the distribution of mtDNA diversity across species and
	relating it to allozyme diversity, life-history traits, and taxonomy,
	we show that (i) mtDNA in mammals does not reject the nearly neutral
	model; (ii) mtDNA diversity, however, is unrelated to any of the
	14 life-history and ecological variables that we analyzed, including
	body mass, geographic range, and The World Conservation Union (IUCN)
	categorization; (iii) mtDNA diversity is highly variable between
	mammalian orders and families; (iv) this taxonomic effect is most
	likely explained by variations of mutation rate between lineages.
	These results are indicative of a strong stochasticity of effective
	population size in mammalian species. They suggest that, even in
	the absence of selection, mtDNA genetic diversity is essentially
	unpredictable, knowing species biology, and probably uncorrelated
	to species abundance.},

	of influenza A virus in temperate climates is one of the most puzzling
	epidemiological patterns in infectious disease. To help resolve the
	issue of influenza seasonality, we studied, using viral genome sequence
	data, the patterns of global migration of influenza A virus, particularly
	between the northern and southern hemispheres. A phylogenetic analysis
	of approximately 900 complete genomes of the H3N2 subtype of human
	influenza A virus sampled from New Zealand and Australia (southern
	hemisphere), and New York state, United States (northern hemisphere),
	revealed that cross-hemisphere migration frequently occurs in both
	directions and involves multiple viral strains. Such global viral
	traffic therefore contributes significantly to the introduction of
	new influenza epidemics in both northern and southern hemispheres.
	These results also show that influenza A virus migrates afar during
	non-epidemic periods, rather than persisting locally at low levels
	during the influenza “off-season”. However, although this represents
	the largest and first bihemisphere study of its kind to our knowledge,
	the results highlight the need for sampling from tropical regions
	and during non-epidemic periods in temperate areas. Studies of this
	kind are critical to fully understand the geographical dispersal
	of influenza A virus and the role of climate in triggering seasonal
	epidemics.</p></sec>},

	is a new package for the analysis of population genetic data. It
	is written in R and is integrated with two other existing R packages
	(ape and adegenet). pegas provides functions for standard population
	genetic methods, as well as low-level functions for developing new
	methods. The flexible and efficient graphical capabilities of R are
	used for plotting haplotype networks as well as for other functionalities.
	pegas emphasizes the need to further develop an integrated-modular
	approach for software dedicated to the analysis of population genetic
	data. AVAILABILITY: pegas is distributed through the Comprehensive
	R Archive Network (CRAN): http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pegas/index.html
	Further information may be found at: http://ape.mpl.ird.fr/pegas/

  abstract = {Existing methods to ascertain small sets of markers for the identification
	of human population structure require prior knowledge of individual
	ancestry. Based on Principal Components Analysis (PCA), and recent
	results in theoretical computer science, we present a novel algorithm
	that, applied on genomewide data, selects small subsets of SNPs (PCA-correlated
	SNPs) to reproduce the structure found by PCA on the complete dataset,
	without use of ancestry information. Evaluating our method on a previously
	described dataset (10,805 SNPs, 11 populations), we demonstrate that
	a very small set of PCA-correlated SNPs can be effectively employed
	to assign individuals to particular continents or populations, using
	a simple clustering algorithm. We validate our methods on the HapMap
	populations and achieve perfect intercontinental differentiation
	with 14 PCA-correlated SNPs. The Chinese and Japanese populations
	can be easily differentiated using less than 100 PCA-correlated SNPs
	ascertained after evaluating 1.7 million SNPs from HapMap. We show
	that, in general, structure informative SNPs are not portable across
	geographic regions. However, we manage to identify a general set
	of 50 PCA-correlated SNPs that effectively assigns individuals to
	one of nine different populations. Compared to analysis with the
	measure of informativeness, our methods, although unsupervised, achieved
	similar results. We proceed to demonstrate that our algorithm can
	be effectively used for the analysis of admixed populations without
	having to trace the origin of individuals. Analyzing a Puerto Rican
	dataset (192 individuals, 7,257 SNPs), we show that PCA-correlated
	SNPs can be used to successfully predict structure and ancestry proportions.
	We subsequently validate these SNPs for structure identification
	in an independent Puerto Rican dataset. The algorithm that we introduce
	runs in seconds and can be easily applied on large genome-wide datasets,
	facilitating the identification of population substructure, stratification
	assessment in multi-stage whole-genome association studies, and the
	study of demographic history in human populations.},

	Our study contrasts the effectiveness, in terms of power and type

	as powerful or more powerful than the Mantel test for detecting matrix
	association under a variety of possible scenarios. As a result of
	the increased power of PROTEST and the ability to assess the match
	for individual observations (not available with the Mantel test),
	biologists now have an additional and powerful analytical tool to
	study ecological and evolutionary relationships.},

	mutation schemes and estimate the variance in mutation size simultaneously
	with the demographic parameters of interest. Our finding of a recent
	common ancestor (probably in the last 120,000 years), coupled with
	a strong signal of demographic expansion in all populations, suggests
	either a recent human expansion from a small ancestral population,

	chains were characterized by means of different clinical/demographic

  abstract = {Phylogenetic methods produce hierarchies of molecular species, inferring
	knowledge about taxonomy and evolution. However, there is not yet
	a consensus methodology that provides a crisp partition of taxa,
	desirable when considering the problem of intra/inter-patient quasispecies
	classification or infection transmission event identification. We
	introduce the threshold bootstrap clustering (TBC), a new methodology
	for partitioning molecular sequences, that does not require a phylogenetic
	tree estimation.The TBC is an incremental partition algorithm, inspired
	by the stochastic Chinese restaurant process, and takes advantage
	of resampling techniques and models of sequence evolution. TBC uses
	as input a multiple alignment of molecular sequences and its output
	is a crisp partition of the taxa into an automatically determined
	number of clusters. By varying initial conditions, the algorithm
	can produce different partitions. We describe a procedure that selects
	a prime partition among a set of candidate ones and calculates a
	measure of cluster reliability. TBC was successfully tested for the
	identification of type-1 human immunodeficiency and hepatitis C virus
	subtypes, and compared with previously established methodologies.
	It was also evaluated in the problem of HIV-1 intra-patient quasispecies
	clustering, and for transmission cluster identification, using a
	set of sequences from patients with known transmission event histories.TBC
	has been shown to be effective for the subtyping of HIV and HCV,
	and for identifying intra-patient quasispecies. To some extent, the
	algorithm was able also to infer clusters corresponding to events
	of infection transmission. The computational complexity of TBC is
	quadratic in the number of taxa, lower than other established methods;
	in addition, TBC has been enhanced with a measure of cluster reliability.
	The TBC can be useful to characterise molecular quasipecies in a
	broad context.},

	of infectious pathogens, such as viral quasispecies. Although methodologies

	have been developed and refined for NGS data, reconstructing a viral
	quasispecies using NGS data remains a challenge. This application

	Here we introduce a set of formulae for the combinatorial analysis

	for quasispecies reconstruction. We require that sequenced fragments
	are aligned against a reference genome, and that the reference genome
	is partitioned into a set of sliding windows (amplicons). The reconstruction
	algorithm is based on combinations of multinomial distributions and
	is designed to minimise the reconstruction of false variants, called
	in-silico recombinants.The reconstruction algorithm was applied to
	error-free simulated data and reconstructed a high percentage of
	true variants, even at a low genetic diversity, where the chance
	to obtain in-silico recombinants is high. Results on empirical NGS
	data from patients infected with hepatitis B virus, confirmed its
	ability to characterise different viral variants from distinct patients.The

  abstract = {Accurate inferences on population genetics data require a sound underlying
	theoretical null model. Organisms alternating sexual and asexual
	reproduction during their life-cycle have been largely neglected
	in theoretical population genetic models, thus limiting the biological
	interpretation of population genetics parameters measured in natural
	populations. In this article, we derive the expectations of those
	parameters for the life-cycle of monoecious trematodes, a group comprising
	several important human and livestock parasites that obligatorily
	alternate sexual and asexual reproduction during their life-cycle.
	We model how migration rates between hosts, sexual and asexual mutation
	rates, adult selfing rate and the variance in reproductive success
	of parasites during the clonal phase affect the amount of neutral
	genetic diversity of the parasite (effective population size) and
	its apportionment within and between definitive hosts (using F-statistics).
	We demonstrate, in particular, that variance in reproductive success
	of clones, a parameter that has been completely overlooked in previous
	population genetics models, is very important in shaping the distribution
	of the genetic variability both within and among definitive hosts.
	Within definitive hosts, the parameter F(IS) (a measure of the deviation
	from random mating) is decreased by high variance in clonal reproductive
	success of larvae but increased by high adult self-fertilisation
	rates. Both clonal multiplication and selfing have similar effects
	on between-host genetic differentiation (F(ST)). Migration occurring
	before and after asexual reproduction can have different effects
	on the patterns of F(IS), depending on values of the other parameters
	such as the mutation rate. While the model applies to any hermaphroditic
	organism alternating sexual and clonal reproduction (e.g. many plants),
	the results are specifically discussed in the light of the limited
	population genetic data on monoecious trematodes available to date
	and their previous interpretation. We hope that our model will encourage
	more empirical population genetics studies on monoecious trematodes
	and other organisms with similar life-cycles.},

  abstract = { <title>Author Summary</title> <p>Although dengue is a major cause
	of morbidity in many tropical and subtropical regions of the world,
	little is known about how the causative virus (dengue virus, DENV)
	spreads through endemic populations. To address this issue we undertook
	a phylogeny-based analysis of 751 complete genome sequences of DENV-1
	sampled from patients in southern Vietnam during 2003â2008. We
	show that multiple viral lineages co-circulate within the urban area
	of Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), and spread at approximately equivalent
	rates through overlapping geographical areas, suggesting that they
	are of equivalent fitness. We also observed that DENV-1 within HCMC
	tended to disperse from more to less densely populated regions, and
	that this city was the source population for DENV-1 in the rural
	area of Dong Thap. Despite the high prevalence of DENV-1 in southern
	Vietnam, viral dispersion rates were relatively low, especially in
	HCMC where they averaged less then 20 km/year. Such a low rate is
	consistent with predominantly mosquito-borne spatial dispersal of
	DENV-1 in this urban setting containing a large number of susceptibles.
	Together, these results suggest that dengue control measures such
	as insecticide spraying should be directed toward the most densely
	populated regions of localities where the virus is endemic.</p> },

	genetic differentiation with geographic distance. Here we find a
	linear relationship between genetic and geographic distance in a
	worldwide sample of human populations, with major deviations from
	the fitted line explicable by admixture or extreme isolation. A close
	relationship is shown to exist between the correlation of geographic
	distance and genetic differentiation (as measured by F(ST)) and the
	geographic pattern of heterozygosity across populations. Considering
	a worldwide set of geographic locations as possible sources of the

	populations of the data set are best explained by an expansion originating
	in Africa and that no geographic origin outside of Africa accounts
	as well for the observed patterns of genetic diversity. Although
	the relationship between F(ST) and geographic distance has been interpreted
	in the past as the result of an equilibrium model of drift and dispersal,
	simulation shows that the geographic pattern of heterozygosities
	in this data set is consistent with a model of a serial founder effect
	starting at a single origin. Given this serial-founder scenario,
	the relationship between genetic and geographic distance allows us
	to derive bounds for the effects of drift and natural selection on

	of the fact that changes in population size can dramatically affect

	in population size from a genealogy. However, in order for past population
	dynamics to be inferred, a demographic model must be specified. Current
	methods use demographic models that are often too simple for populations
	undergoing complex dynamics and generally do not allow for the parameters
	influencing the population dynamics to be estimated. We show how
	current phylodynamic methods can be extended to allow a much wider

  abstract = {Most genetic and archeological evidence argue in favor of a recent
	and unique origin of modern humans in sub-Saharan Africa, but no
	attempt has ever been made at quantifying the likelihood of this
	model, relative to alternative hypotheses of human evolution. In
	this paper, we investigate the possibility of using multilocus genetic
	data to correctly infer the geographic origin of humans, and to distinguish
	between a unique origin (UO) and a multiregional evolution (ME) model.
	We introduce here an approach based on realistic simulations of the
	genetic diversity expected after an expansion process of modern humans
	into the Old World from different possible areas and their comparison
	to observed data. We find that the geographic origin of the expansion
	can be correctly recovered provided that a large number of independent
	markers are used, and that precise information on past demography
	and potential places of origins is available. In that case, it is
	also possible to unambiguously distinguish between a unique origin
	and a multiregional model of human evolution. Application to a real
	human data set of 377 STR markers tested in 22 populations points
	toward a unique but surprising North African origin of modern humans.
	We show that this result could be due to ascertainment bias in favor
	of markers selected to be polymorphic in Europeans. A new estimation
	modeling this bias explicitly reveals that East Africa is the most
	likely place of origin for modern humans.},

	in the selective regime, or in some combination thereof can influence
	both the evolution of continuous traits and their relation to each

	examine their influence on multivariate phenotypic diversification.
	We propose a new likelihood method to fit multiple evolutionary rate
	matrices (also called evolutionary variance-covariance matrices)
	to species data for two or more continuous characters and a phylogeny.
	The evolutionary rate matrix is a matrix containing the evolutionary
	rates for individual characters on its diagonal, and the covariances
	between characters (of which the evolutionary correlations are a
	function) elsewhere. To illustrate our approach, we apply the method
	to an empirical dataset consisting of two features of feeding morphology
	sampled from 28 centrarchid fish species, as well as to data generated
	via phylogenetic numerical simulations. We find that the method has
	appropriate type I error, power, and parameter estimation. The approach
	presented herein is the first to allow for the explicit testing of

  abstract = {A recent advance in the phylogenetic comparative analysis of continuous

	signal" in data sets composed of observations collected from species
	related by a phylogenetic tree. Phylogenetic signal is a measure
	of the statistical dependence among species' trait values due to
	their phylogenetic relationships. Although phylogenetic signal is
	a measure of pattern (statistical dependence), there has nonetheless
	been a widespread propensity in the literature to attribute this
	pattern to aspects of the evolutionary process or rate. This may
	be due, in part, to the perception that high evolutionary rate necessarily
	results in low phylogenetic signal; and, conversely, that low evolutionary
	rate or stabilizing selection results in high phylogenetic signal
	(due to the resulting high resemblance between related species).
	In this study, we use individual-based numerical simulations on stochastic
	phylogenetic trees to clarify the relationship between phylogenetic
	signal, rate, and evolutionary process. Under the simplest model
	for quantitative trait evolution, homogeneous rate genetic drift,
	there is no relation between evolutionary rate and phylogenetic signal.
	For other circumstances, such as functional constraint, fluctuating
	selection, niche conservatism, and evolutionary heterogeneity, the
	relationship between process, rate, and phylogenetic signal is complex.
	For these reasons, we recommend against interpretations of evolutionary

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The inference of the hidden structure of a population
	is an essential issue in population genetics. Recently, several methods
	have been proposed to infer population structure in population genetics.
	METHODS: In this study, a new method to infer the number of clusters
	and to assign individuals to the inferred populations is proposed.
	This approach does not make any assumption on Hardy-Weinberg and
	linkage equilibrium. The implemented criterion is the maximisation
	(via a simulated annealing algorithm) of the averaged genetic distance
	between a predefined number of clusters. The performance of this
	method is compared with two Bayesian approaches: STRUCTURE and BAPS,
	using simulated data and also a real human data set. RESULTS: The
	simulations show that with a reduced number of markers, BAPS overestimates
	the number of clusters and presents a reduced proportion of correct
	groupings. The accuracy of the new method is approximately the same
	as for STRUCTURE. Also, in Hardy-Weinberg and linkage disequilibrium
	cases, BAPS performs incorrectly. In these situations, STRUCTURE
	and the new method show an equivalent behaviour with respect to the
	number of inferred clusters, although the proportion of correct groupings
	is slightly better with the new method. Re-establishing equilibrium
	with the randomisation procedures improves the precision of the Bayesian
	approaches. All methods have a good precision for F(ST) >or= 0.03,
	but only STRUCTURE estimates the correct number of clusters for F(ST)
	as low as 0.01. In situations with a high number of clusters or a
	more complex population structure, MGD performs better than STRUCTURE
	and BAPS. The results for a human data set analysed with the new
	method are congruent with the geographical regions previously found.
	CONCLUSION: This new method used to infer the hidden structure in
	a population, based on the maximisation of the genetic distance and
	not taking into consideration any assumption about Hardy-Weinberg
	and linkage equilibrium, performs well under different simulated
	scenarios and with real data. Therefore, it could be a useful tool
	to determine genetically homogeneous groups, especially in those
	situations where the number of clusters is high, with complex population
	structure and where Hardy-Weinberg and/or linkage equilibrium are
	present.},

	in the distribution of nucleotide (or restriction) site differences
	between pairs of individuals. These signatures appear in histograms
	showing the relative frequencies of pairs of individuals who differ
	by i sites, where i = 0, 1, .... In this distribution an episode
	of growth generates a wave that travels to the right, traversing
	1 unit of the horizontal axis in each 1/2u generations, where u is
	the mutation rate. The smaller the initial population, the steeper
	will be the leading face of the wave. The larger the increase in
	population size, the smaller will be the distribution's vertical
	intercept. The implications of continued exponential growth are indistinguishable
	from those of a sudden burst of population growth Bottlenecks in
	population size also generate waves similar to those produced by
	a sudden expansion, but with elevated uppertail probabilities. Reductions
	in population size initially generate L-shaped distributions with
	high probability of identity, but these converge rapidly to a new
	equilibrium. In equilibrium populations the theoretical curves are
	free of waves. However, computer simulations of such populations
	generate empirical distributions with many peaks and little resemblance
	to the theory. On the other hand, agreement is better in the transient
	(nonequilibrium) case, where simulated empirical distributions typically
	exhibit waves very similar to those predicted by theory. Thus, waves
	in empirical distributions may be rich in information about the history
	of population dynamics.},

	criteria, and their genetic heterogeneity tested on the basis of
	9 autosomal microsatellite and mitochondrial DNA polymorphisms for
	a total of 85 microsatellite allele and 10 mtDNA haplogroup frequencies.
	A preliminary account of the results shows that: a) the samples are
	genetically heterogeneous; b) the first principal coordinates of
	the samples are correlated more with their longitude than with their
	latitude, and this result is even more remarkable when one outlier
	sample (Butera) is not considered; c) distances among samples calculated
	from allele and haplogroup frequencies and from the isonymy matrix
	are weakly correlated (r = 0.43, P = 0.06) but such correlation disappears
	(r = 0.16) if the mtDNA haplogroups alone are taken into account;
	d) mtDNA haplogroups and microsatellite distances suggest settlements
	of people occurred at different times: divergence times inferred
	from microsatellite data seem to describe a genetic composition of
	the town of Sciacca mainly derived from settlements after the Roman
	conquest of Sicily (First Punic war, 246 BC), while all other divergence
	times take root from the second to the first millennium BC, and therefore
	seem to backdate to the pre-Hellenistic period. A more reliable association
	of these diachronic genetic strata to different historical populations
	(e.g. Sicani, Elymi, Siculi), if possible, must be postponed to the
	analysis of more samples and hopefully more informative uniparental
	DNA markers such as the recently available DHPLC-SNP polymorphisms
	of the Y chromosome.},

  abstract = {Our understanding of the distribution of worldwide human genomic diversity
	has greatly increased over recent years thanks to the availability
	of large data sets derived from short tandem repeats (STRs), insertion
	deletion polymorphisms (indels) and single nucleotide polymorphisms
	(SNPs). A concern, however, is that the current picture of worldwide
	human genomic diversity may be inaccurate because of biases in the
	selection process of genetic markers (so-called 'ascertainment bias').
	To evaluate this problem, we first compared the distribution of genomic
	diversity between these three types of genetic markers in the populations
	from the HGDP-CEPH panel for evidence of bias or incongruities. In
	a second step, using a very relaxed set of criteria to prevent the
	intrusion of bias, we developed a new set of unbiased STR markers
	and compared the results against those from available panels. Contrarily
	to recent claims, our results show that the STR markers suffer from
	no discernible bias, and can thus be used as a baseline reference
	for human genetic diversity and population differentiation. The bias
	on SNPs is moderate compared to that on the set of indels analysed,
	which we recommend should be avoided for work describing the distribution
	of human genetic diversity or making inference on human settlement
	history.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY: phangorn is a package for phylogenetic reconstruction and
	analysis in the R language. Previously it was only possible to estimate
	phylogenetic trees with distance methods in R. phangorn, now offers
	the possibility of reconstructing phylogenies with distance based
	methods, maximum parsimony or maximum likelihood (ML) and performing
	Hadamard conjugation. Extending the general ML framework, this package
	provides the possibility of estimating mixture and partition models.
	Furthermore, phangorn offers several functions for comparing trees,
	phylogenetic models or splits, simulating character data and performing
	congruence analyses. AVAILABILITY: phangorn can be obtained through
	the CRAN homepage http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/phangorn/index.html.
	phangorn is licensed under GPL 2.},

	Although one-third of the world's population live at risk of infection,
	little is known about the pattern and dynamics of dengue virus (DENV)
	within outbreak situations. By exploiting genomic data from an intensively
	studied major outbreak, we are able to describe the molecular epidemiology
	of DENV at a uniquely fine-scaled temporal and spatial resolution.
	Two DENV serotypes (DENV-1 and DENV-3), and multiple component genotypes,
	spread concurrently and with similar epidemiological and evolutionary
	profiles during the initial outbreak phase of a major dengue epidemic
	that took place in Singapore during 2005. Although DENV-1 and DENV-3
	differed in viremia and clinical outcome, there was no evidence for
	adaptive evolution before, during, or after the outbreak, indicating
	that ecological or immunological rather than virological factors
	were the key determinants of epidemic dynamics.},

	Previous studies indicate that relative humidity (RH) affects both
	influenza virus transmission (IVT) and influenza virus survival (IVS).
	Here, we reanalyze these data to explore the effects of absolute
	humidity on IVT and IVS. We find that absolute humidity (AH) constrains
	both transmission efficiency and IVS much more significantly than
	RH. In the studies presented, 50\% of IVT variability and 90\% of
	IVS variability are explained by AH, whereas, respectively, only
	12\% and 36\% are explained by RH. In temperate regions, both outdoor
	and indoor AH possess a strong seasonal cycle that minimizes in winter.
	This seasonal cycle is consistent with a wintertime increase in IVS
	and IVT and may explain the seasonality of influenza. Thus, differences
	in AH provide a single, coherent, more physically sound explanation
	for the observed variability of IVS, IVT and influenza seasonality
	in temperate regions. This hypothesis can be further tested through
	future, additional laboratory, epidemiological and modeling studies.},

  abstract = {HIV-1 is one of the fastest evolving entities known. Given that census
	population sizes of HIV-1 within individuals are much greater than
	the inverse mutation rate, every possible single point mutation in
	the viral genome occurs each generation. This enormous capability
	to generate genetic variation allows for escape from immune surveillance
	and antiviral therapy. However, compared to this potential, populations
	of HIV-1 within individuals exhibit little genetic variation. This
	discrepancy between the known mutation rate of HIV-1 and the average
	level of genetic variation in the env gene observed in vivo is reflected
	in comparisons of the actual numbers of productively infected cells,
	estimated as 10(7), and the effective population size, estimated
	as 10(3). Using approximate Bayesian computation, we evaluated several
	hypotheses based on a variety of selective and demographic processes
	to explain the low effective population size of HIV-1. Of the models
	we examined, the metapopulation model, in which HIV-1 evolves within
	an individual as a large collection of small subpopulations subject
	to frequent migration, extinction, and recolonization, was most consistent
	with the observed levels of genetic variation and the average frequencies
	of those variants. The metapopulation model links previous studies

  abstract = {We consider the distribution of pairwise sequence differences of mitochondrial
	DNA or of other nonrecombining portions of the genome in a population
	that has been of constant size and in a population that has been
	growing in size exponentially for a long time. We show that, in a
	population of constant size, the sample distribution of pairwise
	differences will typically deviate substantially from the geometric
	distribution expected, because the history of coalescent events in
	a single sample of genes imposes a substantial correlation on pairwise
	differences. Consequently, a goodness-of-fit test of observed pairwise
	differences to the geometric distribution, which assumes that each
	pairwise comparison is independent, is not a valid test of the hypothesis
	that the genes were sampled from a panmictic population of constant
	size. In an exponentially growing population in which the product
	of the current population size and the growth rate is substantially
	larger than one, our analytical and simulation results show that
	most coalescent events occur relatively early and in a restricted
	range of times. Hence, the "gene tree" will be nearly a "star phylogeny"
	and the distribution of pairwise differences will be nearly a Poisson
	distribution. In that case, it is possible to estimate r, the population
	growth rate, if the mutation rate, mu, and current population size,
	N0, are assumed known. The estimate of r is the solution to ri/mu
	= ln(N0r) - gamma, where i is the average pairwise difference and
	gamma approximately 0.577 is Euler's constant.},

  abstract = {Tuberculosis can be studied at the population level by genotyping
	strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolated from patients. We
	use an approximate Bayesian computational method in combination with
	a stochastic model of tuberculosis transmission and mutation of a
	molecular marker to estimate the net transmission rate, the doubling
	time, and the reproductive value of the pathogen. This method is
	applied to a published data set from San Francisco of tuberculosis
	genotypes based on the marker IS6110. The mutation rate of this marker
	has previously been studied, and we use those estimates to form a
	prior distribution of mutation rates in the inference procedure.
	The posterior point estimates of the key parameters of interest for
	these data are as follows: net transmission rate, 0.69/year [95\%
	credibility interval (C.I.) 0.38, 1.08]; doubling time, 1.08 years
	(95\% C.I. 0.64, 1.82); and reproductive value 3.4 (95\% C.I. 1.4,

  abstract = {<title>Author Summary</title> <p>The study of bacterial population
	biology is complicated by the fact that, although bacteria are largely
	asexual, they can also exchange genetic materials through homologous
	recombination. Unlike eukaryotes, recombination in bacteria is not
	an obligatory process. Furthermore, the recombination mechanisms
	are subject to many biological and ecological factors that can vary
	even within different populations of the same species. Although increasing
	evidence for homologous recombination has been found in many bacterial
	species, determining the frequency of recombination and understanding
	the influence that it exerts upon the evolution of bacterial populations
	remains a challenging work. In this article, we provide a dynamic
	picture of recombination within and between closely related bacteria
	species. Through an integration of several Bayesian statistical models,
	our method highlights the importance of a quantitative estimation
	of recombination. Our analyses of a challenging multi-locus sequence
	typing (MLST) database demonstrate that combined analyses using both
	traditional phylogenetic methods, explorative MLST tools and Bayesian
	population genetic models can together yield interesting biological
	insights that cannot easily be reached by any of the approaches alone.</p>},

	of population demography, in addition to the molecular data. While
	some theoretical results are presented, a central focus is on computational
	methods. These methods are easy to implement, and, since explicit
	formulae tend to be either unavailable or unilluminating, they are
	also more useful and more informative in most applications. Extensions
	are presented that allow for the effects of uncertainty in our knowledge
	of population size and mutation rates, for variability in population
	sizes, for regions of different mutation rate, and for inference
	concerning the coalescence time of the entire population. The methods
	are illustrated using recent data from the human Y chromosome.},

  abstract = {Seasonal influenza has considerable impact around the world, both
	economically and in mortality among risk groups, but there is considerable
	uncertainty as to the essential mechanisms and their parametrization.
	In this paper, we identify a number of characteristic features of
	influenza incidence time series in temperate regions, including ranges
	of annual attack rates and outbreak durations. By constraining the
	output of simple models to match these characteristic features, we
	investigate the role played by population heterogeneity, multiple
	strains, cross-immunity and the rate of strain evolution in the generation
	of incidence time series. Results indicate that an age-structured
	model with non-random mixing and co-circulating strains are both
	required to match observed time-series data. Our work gives estimates
	of the seasonal peak basic reproduction number, R(0), in the range
	1.6-3. Estimates of R(0) are strongly correlated with the timescale
	for waning of immunity to current circulating seasonal influenza
	strain, which we estimate is between 3 and 8 years. Seasonal variation
	in transmissibility is largely confined to 15-30\% of its mean value.
	While population heterogeneity and cross-immunity are required mechanisms,
	the degree of heterogeneity and cross-immunity is not tightly constrained.
	We discuss our findings in the context of other work fitting to seasonal
	influenza data.},

	that can cause branch lengths to be underestimated in areas of the

	introduced a statistical procedure (the “delta” test) to detect this
	artifact, and here we report the results of computer simulations
	that examine the test's performance. In a sample of 50,000 random
	data sets, we find that the delta test detects the artifact in 94.4%
	of cases in which it is present. When the artifact is not present
	(n = 10,000 simulated data sets) the test showed a type I error rate
	of approximately 1.69%, incorrectly reporting the artifact in 169
	data sets. Three measures of tree shape or “balance” failed to predict
	the size of the node-density effect. This may reflect the relative
	homogeneity of our randomly generated topologies, but emphasizes
	that nearly any topology can suffer from the artifact, the effect
	not being confined only to highly unevenly sampled or otherwise imbalanced
	trees. The ability to screen phylogenies for the node-density artifact
	is important for phylogenetic inference and for researchers using
	phylogenetic trees to infer evolutionary processes, including their
	use in molecular clock dating.},

	closely with rates of movement of people to and from their workplaces
	(workflows) than with geographical distance. Workflows are described
	in turn by a gravity model, with a rapid decay of commuting up to
	around 100 km and a long tail of rare longer range flow. A simple
	epidemiological model, based on the gravity formulation, captures
	the observed increase of influenza spatial synchrony with transmissibility;
	high transmission allows influenza to spread rapidly beyond local
	spatial constraints.},

	susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS), and susceptible-infected-recovered
	(SIR) models of infectious disease, and our approach may be a viable
	alternative to demographic models used to reconstruct epidemic dynamics.
	The method allows epidemiological parameters, such as the reproductive
	number, to be estimated directly from viral sequence data. We also
	describe patterns of phylogenetic clustering that are often construed
	as arising from a short chain of transmissions. Our model reproduces
	the moments of the distribution of phylogenetic cluster sizes and
	may therefore serve as a null hypothesis for cluster sizes under
	simple epidemiological models. We examine a small cross-sectional
	sample of human immunodeficiency (HIV)-1 sequences collected in the
	United States and compare our results to standard estimates of effective
	population size. Estimated prevalence is consistent with estimates
	of effective population size and the known history of the HIV epidemic.
	While our model accurately estimates prevalence during exponential
	growth, we find that periods of decline are harder to identify.},

	contagious disease to emerge in the 21st century. The available epidemic
	curves for SARS show marked differences between the affected regions
	with respect to the total number of cases and epidemic duration,
	even for those regions in which outbreaks started almost simultaneously
	and similar control measures were implemented at the same time. The
	authors developed a likelihood-based estimation procedure that infers
	the temporal pattern of effective reproduction numbers from an observed
	epidemic curve. Precise estimates for the effective reproduction
	numbers were obtained by applying this estimation procedure to available
	data for SARS outbreaks that occurred in Hong Kong, Vietnam, Singapore,
	and Canada in 2003. The effective reproduction numbers revealed that
	epidemics in the various affected regions were characterized by markedly
	similar disease transmission potentials and similar levels of effectiveness
	of control measures. In controlling SARS outbreaks, timely alerts
	have been essential: Delaying the institution of control measures
	by 1 week would have nearly tripled the epidemic size and would have
	increased the expected epidemic duration by 4 weeks.},

	An alternative source of data for deciphering migrations and origins

	we review statistical problems and limitations that affect the calculation
	of particular population genetic parameters for these microbes, such
	as mutation rates, with particular emphasis on the effects of recombination,
	selection and mode of transmission. Finally, we extend the discussion
	to other host-parasite systems and advocate the adoption of an integrative

	and the transatlantic slave trade. Other evidence--archeological
	and genetic--suggests a much older origin. We collected and analyzed
	P. falciparum isolates from different regions of the world, encompassing
	the distribution range of the parasite, including populations from
	sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and South America.
	Analyses of microsatellite and SNP polymorphisms show that the populations
	of P. falciparum in South America are subdivided in two main genetic
	clusters (northern and southern). Phylogenetic analyses, as well
	as Approximate Bayesian Computation methods suggest independent introductions
	of the two clusters from African sources. Our estimates of divergence
	time between the South American populations and their likely sources
	favor a likely introduction from Africa during the transatlantic
	slave trade.},

  abstract = {Knowledge on the transmission tree of an epidemic can provide valuable
	insights into disease dynamics. The transmission tree can be reconstructed
	by analysing either detailed epidemiological data (e.g. contact tracing)
	or, if sufficient genetic diversity accumulates over the course of
	the epidemic, genetic data of the pathogen. We present a likelihood-based
	framework to integrate these two data types, estimating probabilities
	of infection by taking weighted averages over the set of possible
	transmission trees. We test the approach by applying it to temporal,
	geographical and genetic data on the 241 poultry farms infected in
	an epidemic of avian influenza A (H7N7) in The Netherlands in 2003.
	We show that the combined approach estimates the transmission tree
	with higher correctness and resolution than analyses based on genetic
	or epidemiological data alone. Furthermore, the estimated tree reveals
	the relative infectiousness of farms of different types and sizes.},

  abstract = {Identification of population structure can help trace population histories
	and identify disease genes. Structured association (SA) is a commonly
	used approach for population structure identification and association
	mapping. A major issue with SA is that its performance greatly depends
	on the informativeness and the numbers of ancestral informative markers
	(AIMs). Present major AIM selection methods mostly require prior
	individual ancestry information, which is usually not available or
	uncertain in practice. To address this potential weakness, we herein
	develop a novel approach for AIM selection based on principle component
	analysis (PCA), which does not require prior ancestry information
	of study subjects. Our simulation and real genetic data analysis
	results suggest that, with equivalent AIMs, PCA-based selected AIMs
	can significantly increase the accuracy of inferred individual ancestries
	compared with traditionally randomly selected AIMs. Our method can
	easily be applied to whole genome data to select a set of highly
	informative AIMs in population structure, which can then be used
	to identify potential population structure and correct possible statistical
	biases caused by population stratification.},

  abstract = {Identification of a small panel of population structure informative
	markers can reduce genotyping cost and is useful in various applications,
	such as ancestry inference in association mapping, forensics and
	evolutionary theory in population genetics. Traditional methods to
	ascertain ancestral informative markers usually require the prior
	knowledge of individual ancestry and have difficulty for admixed
	populations. Recently Principal Components Analysis (PCA) has been
	employed with success to select SNPs which are highly correlated
	with top significant principal components (PCs) without use of individual
	ancestral information. The approach is also applicable to admixed
	populations. Here we propose a novel approach based on our recent
	result on summarizing population structure by graph laplacian eigenfunctions,
	which differs from PCA in that it is geometric and robust to outliers.
	Our approach also takes advantage of the priori sparseness of informative
	markers in the genome. Through simulation of a ring population and
	the real global population sample HGDP of 650K SNPs genotyped in
	940 unrelated individuals, we validate the proposed algorithm at
	selecting most informative markers, a small fraction of which can
	recover the similar underlying population structure efficiently.
	Employing a standard Support Vector Machine (SVM) to predict individuals'
	continental memberships on HGDP dataset of seven continents, we demonstrate
	that the selected SNPs by our method are more informative but less
	redundant than those selected by PCA. Our algorithm is a promising
	tool in genome-wide association studies and population genetics,
	facilitating the selection of structure informative markers, efficient
	detection of population substructure and ancestral inference.},
